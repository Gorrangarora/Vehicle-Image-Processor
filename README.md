# Vehicle Image Processor

<<<<<<< HEAD
Converts JPG, PNG, and PDF files into standardized JPEG images.
Part of the AI-powered vehicle image pipeline project.

---

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

### Option A — Command line (Phase 2)

1. Drop files into the `input/` folder
2. Run the script:

```bash
python processor.py
```

3. Find results in `output/`
4. Check logs in `logs/`

### Option B — Streamlit dashboard (Phase 5)

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Opens at `http://localhost:8501` — upload files via browser, download a ZIP of results.
=======
A Python-based image processing pipeline that converts vehicle images from any format into standardized JPEG output. Built as part of an AI-powered vehicle data project at Shriram Automall India Limited (SAMIL).

---

## What it does

Takes image files in any format from an `input/` folder, converts them all to high-quality JPEG, and saves them to an `output/` folder. Every run generates a detailed CSV report showing input dimensions, output dimensions, file sizes, and conversion status.

---

## Supported input formats

| Format | Extension | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| JPEG | `.jpg` `.jpeg` | Re-encoded at quality 95 |
| PNG | `.png` | Transparency replaced with white background |
| BMP | `.bmp` | Direct convert |
| TIFF | `.tif` `.tiff` | Multi-page supported |
| WebP | `.webp` | Direct convert |
| GIF | `.gif` | Each frame saved as separate JPEG |
| ICO | `.ico` | Direct convert |
| HEIC | `.heic` `.heif` | iPhone camera photos |
| RAW | `.raw` `.cr2` `.nef` `.arw` `.dng` `.orf` | Camera RAW files |
| SVG | `.svg` | Vector rendered to raster (Windows needs Cairo) |
| PDF | `.pdf` | Each page saved as separate JPEG |

---

## Output

- Format: **JPEG**
- Quality: **95 / 95** (maximum)
- Dimensions: **Same as input** (no resizing)
- Naming: `filename.jpg` for single images, `filename_page01.jpg` for PDF pages, `filename_frame01.jpg` for GIF frames

## What it handles

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| `.jpg` / `.jpeg` | Standardized JPEG (resized, mode-fixed) |
| `.png` (including transparent) | JPEG with white background |
| `.pdf` | One JPEG per page at 2× resolution |
=======
## Setup

### Step 1 — Install Python libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2 — Drop files into input/

Copy any image files (JPG, PNG, PDF, BMP, TIFF, WebP, GIF, HEIC, RAW, SVG, ICO) into the `input/` folder.

---

## How to run

### Option A — Terminal (command line)

```bash
python processor.py
```

Results appear in `output/`. Log saved in `logs/`.

### Option B — Streamlit dashboard (browser UI)

```bash
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

Opens at `http://localhost:8501` in your browser. Upload files, click Process, view gallery, download ZIP.

## Notes on specific formats

**PDF** — A 5-page PDF produces 5 separate JPEG files, one per page. Pages are rendered at 3× zoom (216 DPI) for high clarity.

**GIF** — Animated GIFs produce one JPEG per frame. A 3-frame GIF produces 3 JPEGs.

**SVG** — Requires the Cairo system library. On Windows, install GTK from:
`https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases`
If Cairo is not installed, SVG files are skipped and all other formats still work.

**RAW** — Requires `rawpy` and `libraw`. On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install libraw-dev`. On Windows, rawpy usually installs libraw automatically via pip.

**HEIC** — iPhone photos. Requires `pillow-heif` which is included in requirements.txt.

## Quality and dimensions

| Setting | Value | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Output format | JPEG | Standard, widely compatible |
| JPEG quality | 95 | Maximum quality, minimal compression |
| Resizing | Disabled | Output dimensions = input dimensions always |

There is no resizing. A 4000×3000 input always produces a 4000×3000 output.

JPEG re-encoding adds a very small second-generation quality loss (invisible at quality 95) when the input is already a JPEG. For RAW, PNG, BMP, TIFF inputs there is effectively zero visual quality loss.
